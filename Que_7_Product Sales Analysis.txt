/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */
select p.product_name,s.year,s.price from Sales s inner join Product p
On s.product_id =p.product_id 

Based on your question:

Since the goal is to return a valid product_name for every sale, INNER JOIN is the best option because it ensures that only the rows with matching product_id values in both the Sales and Product tables are included in the result.
If, however, you want to include sales even if a product isn't found in the Product table, then use LEFT JOIN.

Conclusion:
Use INNER JOIN if you're sure every sale has a corresponding product and you don't want to include sales without matching products.
Use LEFT JOIN if you want to include all sales, even if some products are missing from the Product table.
